# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Our aim in this project was to design a CNN  based classifier that classified input images into 10 classes, and testing different structures.

We also used an open source structure (AlexNet) and compared between the two approaches using 10 classes from Caltech 101 dataset.

This project was done on Google Colab
